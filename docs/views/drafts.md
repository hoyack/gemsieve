# Drafts

[Back to Manual](../manual.md)

The Drafts view shows engagement drafts generated by Stage 7. Each draft is a personalized outreach message created by the AI for a specific gem (commercial opportunity).

## List view columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **id** | Draft identifier |
| **gem_id** | Which gem this draft was generated for |
| **sender_domain** | The target sender's domain |
| **strategy** | Engagement strategy used (audit, revival, partner, etc.) |
| **channel** | Recommended outreach channel |
| **subject_line** | Suggested email subject line |
| **status** | `draft`, `sent`, or `archived` |
| **generated_at** | When the draft was created |

Additional columns in detail view: body_text, sent_at, response_received.

## Searching

Search by **sender_domain**, **strategy**, or **subject_line**.

## Sorting

Sort by **strategy**, **status**, or **generated_at**. Default sort is by generated_at (newest first).

## How to use

### Review generated drafts

1. Sort by **generated_at** (newest first) to see the latest drafts
2. Click a row to see the full **body_text** — the complete outreach message
3. The subject_line is ready to use as an email subject

### Understand the strategy

Each draft uses a strategy matched to the gem type:

| Gem Type | Strategy | Channel |
|----------|----------|---------|
| weak_marketing_lead | audit | email reply or cold email |
| industry_intel | industry_report | content publication + tag |
| dormant_warm_thread | revival | reply to original thread |
| unanswered_ask | revival | reply to original thread |
| partner_program | partner | partner program URL or vendor contact |
| renewal_leverage | renewal_negotiation | direct email to account rep |
| vendor_upsell | mirror | email reply showing your capabilities |
| distribution_channel | distribution_pitch | application or pitch email |
| co_marketing | mirror | email reply showing your capabilities |
| procurement_signal | audit | email reply or cold email |

### Track outreach

1. After sending a draft, update the status to `sent`
2. If you receive a response, mark `response_received` as true
3. Filter by **status** = `draft` to see unsent messages

## Generating drafts

Drafts can be generated in three ways:

1. **Gem Explorer** — click **Generate Draft** on any gem card in the [Gem Explorer](gem-explorer.md)
2. **Pipeline Control** — run the engage stage from [Pipeline Control](pipeline.md) to generate drafts for all eligible gems
3. **CLI** — `gemsieve generate --gem 42` or `gemsieve generate --strategy audit --top 10`

## What the AI receives

The engagement prompt includes:
- Gem type and explanation (why this opportunity was detected)
- Sender's company profile (industry, size, ESP, sophistication)
- Known contacts (names and roles)
- Your service description and preferred tone (from config)

See [AI Inspector](ai-inspector.md) to view the exact prompts and responses.
